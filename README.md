## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Flexbox**
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

One key takeaway from this project was learning how to use the `:active` pseudo-class to change styles when an element is clicked. 
This helped me understand how user interactions can be styled dynamically.

Example of what I learned:
```css
h2:active {
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued Development

Going forward, I want to improve the naming of my CSS classes to make them more descriptive and easier for other developers to understand. 
Additionally, I want to improve my coding structure since my current code feels a bit messy, and I aim to make it more maintainable.

### Useful Resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped me understand how specific CSS functions work, especially pseudo-classes like `:active`.
